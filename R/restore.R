#' Restore a Project
#'
#' Restore a project's dependencies from a lockfile, as previously generated by
#' [snapshot()].
#'
#' @param lockfile The lockfile to be used for restoration of the associated
#'   project. When `NULL`, the most recently generated lockfile for this project
#'   is used.
#'
#' @param actions The restore actions to take. By default, all actions are
#'   taken, thereby synchronizing the state of the project library with that of
#'   the lockfile. See **Actions** for more details.
#'
#' @section Actions:
#'
#' `renv` classifies the different actions that will be taken during restore
#' into five fundamental types:
#'
#' \tabular{ll}{
#'
#' \code{install} \tab
#'   Install a package recorded in the lockfile,
#'   but not currently installed in the project library. \cr
#'
#' \code{remove} \tab
#'   Remove a package installed in the project library,
#'   but not currently recorded in the lockfile. \cr
#'
#' \code{upgrade} \tab
#'   Upgrade a package by replacing the (older) version of the package
#'   available in the project library with a newer version as defined
#'   in the lockfile. \cr
#'
#' \code{downgrade} \tab
#'   Downgrade a package by replacing the (newer) version of the package
#'   available in the project library with an older version as defined
#'   in the lockfile. \cr
#'
#' \code{crossgrade} \tab
#'   Install a package whose lockfile record differs from the inferred
#'   record associated with the currently-installed version. This could
#'   happen if, for example, the source of a particular package was changed
#'   (e.g. a package originally installed from GitHub was later installed
#'   from CRAN). \cr
#'
#' }
#'
#' This can be useful if you want to perform only non-destructive changes during
#' restore -- for example, you can invoke `renv::restore(actions = "install")`
#' to avoid modifying or removing packages that have already been installed into
#' your project's private library.
