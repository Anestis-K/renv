`renv` uses a **lockfile** to capture the state of your \R library at some point in time.
It is stored as a collection of *records*, with different records defining:

- The version of `renv` used when generating the lockfile;
- The version of `R` used in that project;
- The R repositories that were active when the lockfile was created;
- R *package records* defining each package, their version, and their installation source.

For example, here is a simple lockfile capturing a single package `Matrix`:

```
[renv]
Version=0.2.0

[R]
Version=3.5.3
Repositories=
	CRAN=https://cran.rstudio.com/

[R/Package/Matrix]
Package=Matrix
Version=1.2-17
Source=CRAN
Hash=b10030fd8c964dbecd79719236d4a668
```

The function `renv::snapshot()` is used to create this lockfile, and by default writes
these records to the file `renv.lock`. Later, if you need to reinstall the specific
package versions as recorded in `renv.lock`, you can use `renv::restore()`.
